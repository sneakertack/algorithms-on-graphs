C programming practice implementations of graph algorithms, done for a MOOC course on the topic.

Programs should be compiled with `gcc -pipe -O2 -std=c11`. Each program is self contained aside from reliance on the standard C headers. Input follows the format defined in the MOOC (occluded). Check the first comment in a program's source code to determine how the program returns output.
